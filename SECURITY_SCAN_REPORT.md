# ArchGuardian Security Scan Report

**Scan Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Tool:** gosec v2.22.9  
**Total Issues:** 115

## Critical Security Issues

### HIGH Severity Issues

1. **G101 - Potential hardcoded credentials** (Confidence: LOW, Severity: HIGH)
   - Location: `main.go:274`
   - Issue: Hardcoded GitHub OAuth token URL
   - Recommendation: Consider using environment variables or configuration files

2. **G115 - Integer overflow conversion** (Confidence: MEDIUM, Severity: HIGH)
   - Location: `inference_engine/gemini_provider.go:407`
   - Issue: Potential integer overflow when converting int to int32
   - Recommendation: Add bounds checking before conversion

### MEDIUM Severity Issues

1. **G114 - Missing HTTP server timeouts** (Confidence: HIGH, Severity: MEDIUM)
   - Locations: `main.go:6768`, `main.go:7603`
   - Issue: HTTP servers using `ListenAndServe` without timeout configuration
   - Recommendation: Use `http.Server` with proper timeout settings

2. **G204 - Subprocess with tainted input** (Confidence: HIGH, Severity: MEDIUM)
   - Locations: `main.go:3511`, `main.go:3526`
   - Issue: Executing commands with user-controlled input
   - Recommendation: Validate and sanitize input before command execution

3. **G304 - File inclusion via variable** (Confidence: HIGH, Severity: MEDIUM)
   - Multiple locations in `main.go`
   - Issue: Reading files using user-controlled paths
   - Recommendation: Validate file paths and restrict to safe directories

### LOW Severity Issues

1. **G104 - Unhandled errors** (Confidence: HIGH, Severity: LOW)
   - Multiple locations throughout the codebase
   - Issue: Ignoring return values from functions that return errors
   - Recommendation: Properly handle all error returns

## Summary by Issue Type

| Issue Type | Count | Severity |
|------------|-------|----------|
| G104 (Unhandled errors) | 70+ | LOW |
| G304 (File inclusion) | 20+ | MEDIUM |
| G114 (HTTP timeouts) | 2 | MEDIUM |
| G204 (Tainted subprocess) | 2 | MEDIUM |
| G101 (Hardcoded credentials) | 1 | HIGH |
| G115 (Integer overflow) | 1 | HIGH |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (HIGH Priority)
1. Fix the integer overflow vulnerability in `gemini_provider.go`
2. Move hardcoded URLs to configuration
3. Implement proper HTTP server timeouts

### Medium-term Actions
1. Add input validation for all file operations
2. Sanitize inputs for command execution
3. Implement proper error handling throughout the codebase

### Long-term Actions
1. Establish security review process for new code
2. Implement automated security testing in CI/CD
3. Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize fixing HIGH severity issues
2. Address MEDIUM severity issues in the next development cycle
3. Implement automated security scanning in the build pipeline
4. Consider using `// #nosec` comments for intentional security trade-offs with proper justification
