# ArchGuardian Public Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2024-07-26

## Introduction

ArchGuardian is committed to ensuring the security of our platform and the trust of our users. We value the contributions of independent security researchers and believe that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us improve our security posture. This policy outlines the process for reporting vulnerabilities, what you can expect from us, and the guidelines for conducting vulnerability research.

Our goal is to work collaboratively with the security community to verify, reproduce, and respond to legitimate vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This policy applies to security vulnerabilities discovered in the following ArchGuardian systems and services:

*   The ArchGuardian application and its source code, located in the official `guiperry/archguardian` repository.
*   The public-facing API endpoints hosted by the application (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/*`).
*   The official ArchGuardian website and documentation.

Any service not explicitly listed above, such as third-party services we use, are excluded from the scope of this policy. If you believe you have found a vulnerability in a third-party service we utilize, we encourage you to report it directly to that service provider according to their disclosure policy.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in one of our in-scope services, please report it to us by emailing **`security@archguardian.knirv.com`**.

Please include the following details in your report to help us validate and reproduce the issue:

*   A clear description of the vulnerability, including its type (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection, Remote Code Execution).
*   The service, product, and version affected.
*   Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   Proof-of-concept code, scripts, screenshots, or screen recordings.
*   Any potential impact of the vulnerability.

## Our Process (What to Expect)

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we are committed to the following process:

1.  **Acknowledgement:** We will provide an initial acknowledgement of your report within two (2) business days.
2.  **Triage & Validation:** We will work to validate the reported vulnerability. We may contact you for additional information if needed.
3.  **Remediation:** If the vulnerability is validated, we will prioritize it for remediation based on its severity and impact. We will work to release a fix in a timely manner.
4.  **Communication:** We will maintain an open line of communication with you, providing periodic updates on our progress.
5.  **Public Disclosure & Recognition:** Once the vulnerability is remediated, we will coordinate public disclosure with you. We are happy to provide public recognition for your contribution. As a prospective CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), we will assign a CVE ID to the validated vulnerability and publish a security advisory.

## Guidelines for Researchers

We ask that you act in good faith and follow these guidelines when conducting your research:

*   Do not access, modify, or exfiltrate any data that does not belong to you.
*   Do not perform any action that could degrade, disrupt, or negatively impact our services or users.
*   Do not perform social engineering or phishing attacks.
*   Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any public disclosure. We aim to coordinate disclosure with you.
*   Do not violate any applicable laws or regulations.

## Safe Harbor

ArchGuardian will not initiate legal action against security researchers for discovering and reporting vulnerabilities in accordance with this policy. We consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute "authorized" conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and similar laws.

We will work with you to understand and quickly resolve issues you report, and we will not engage or support any legal action against you for your good faith research.

## Public Disclosure

ArchGuardian is committed to transparency. For validated vulnerabilities, we will take the following steps:

1.  **Assign a CVE ID:** As a prospective CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), we will assign a CVE identifier to the vulnerability.
2.  **Publish a Security Advisory:** We will publish a security advisory on our official GitHub repository or website. The advisory will include details of the vulnerability, its impact, the affected versions, and remediation steps.
3.  **Credit the Reporter:** We will credit the security researcher who discovered and reported the vulnerability, unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

This policy does not restrict you, the reporter, from disclosing the vulnerability to others after we have coordinated on a public disclosure date.

## Automated Vulnerability Detection and Reporting

In addition to vulnerabilities reported by the security community, ArchGuardian's core functionality includes the automated detection of potential security issues within the software it analyzes. When our automated systems identify a new, previously unknown vulnerability within an open-source dependency or a common coding pattern that meets the criteria for a CVE, the system will automatically publish a new security advisory to the github repository responsible for committed disclosure.

As a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), our process for these internally discovered vulnerabilities is as follows:

1.  **Internal Validation:** Our security team will validate the automated finding to confirm its impact and uniqueness.
2.  **CVE Assignment:** Upon validation, we will assign a CVE ID to the vulnerability.
3.  **Coordinated Disclosure:** We will follow coordinated disclosure practices, notifying the affected project maintainers and working with them to ensure a fix is available before public disclosure.
4.  **Public Advisory:** Once a fix is available or a reasonable time has passed, we will publish a security advisory with the CVE details to contribute to the public knowledge base.

## CVE Program Terms of Use

By using ArchGuardian for vulnerability detection, reporting, or analysis, all users automatically agree to the [CVE Program Terms of Use](https://www.cve.org/Legal/TermsOfUse). ArchGuardian's vulnerability reporting and disclosure services are subject to these terms.

## Questions

If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at **`security@archguardian.knirv.com`**. We look forward to working with the security community to keep ArchGuardian safe.
